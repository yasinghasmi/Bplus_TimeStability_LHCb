# Bplus_TimeStability_LHCb

Study of the time stability of the yield ratio between the  
**$B^+ \to \overline{D}^0\pi^+$** and **$B^+ \to J/\psi K^+$** decay modes in the 2024 LHCb dataset.

This project evaluates the feasibility of using these decays for a precise measurement of the branching fraction ratio:

$$
\frac{\mathcal{B}(B^+ \to \overline{D}^0\pi^+)}{\mathcal{B}(B^+ \to J/\psi K^+)}
$$

by analyzing the temporal stability of their yield ratio across multiple data-taking blocks and fills.

Mass fits are performed using the sum of two Crystal Ball functions.  
Time stability is evaluated by studying 4 blocks of 2024 run and fills corresponding to each block.   
and fitting the resulting yield ratios to a constant value using a 0th-degree polynomial.

The reduced chi-squared statistic, $\chi^2/\text{ndf}$, is used as a stability metric for each block.
