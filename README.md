# Bplus_TimeStability_LHCb
Study of the time stability of the yield ratio between the B⁺ → D̄⁰π⁺ and B⁺ → J/ψK⁺ decay modes in the 2024 LHCb dataset. This project evaluates the feasibility of using these decays for precise branching fraction ratio measurements by analyzing temporal stability across multiple data-taking blocks using mass fits and time binning.
